            <h2>The truth about music unveiled</h2>
            <p>Do you even realize what music is and does to you? Whenever it starts playing what do you do? That's right, you chant along with it. 
                And subconsciously you start believing in the things you are saying and then want to act on it, even if not the exact same thing you 
                are chanting but at least something similar to it. But most music we chant along with are deceiving us to believe that fuckin bitches and 
                smoking and screwing others over is something we should all be doing. It's so cool! But maybe you can control yourself good for you. 
                But guess what, your mind still processed those words and your brain has been stained!</p>
